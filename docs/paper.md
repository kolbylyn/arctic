# Summary

Acronym is a Python implementation of an automatic reduction pipeline for the Astrophysical Research Consortium Telescope Imaging Camera (ARCTIC). ARCTIC is an optical-wavelength CCD camera mounted on a 3.5 meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory (APO) in Sunspot, New Mexico. 

Given raw ARCTIC images, acronym outputs dark, bias, and flat-corrected images. 

This M106 image is the product of three stacked acronym-reduced images.
